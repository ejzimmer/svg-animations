svg animations

why animation?

- convey information to the user: loading indicators, button jiggle
- smooth out movement: modal entry, hover state movement
- add polish & engagement: because it's fun

today's examples

- based on icons that we use at work. these icons are used on custom radio buttons for selecting different chart types.
- all implemented with just HTML/SVG & CSS

what is SVG

- other image formats are basically a bitmap with a compression algorithm.
